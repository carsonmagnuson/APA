## Some random notes
So I've been crowdsourcing criteria for what makes a good ortholog on various online platforms. Apparently it's a lot trickier than you would think.
A couple people are convinced that it's flat out impossible to automate. Good. That means it will be worth looking at, at the very least.
There were some helpful comments, though, split into two main catagories:
- Topology
- Syntenegy (might be spelled differently, idk)
